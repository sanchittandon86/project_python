Hello Everyone,
I am making this project on Pycharm (we can use vscode as well)
so at first,
we'll have to open the terminal and insatll qrcode (pip insatll qrcode)
and then we have to insatll pillow (pip insatll pillow)
import qrcode will help us to generate qrcode
and taking upi_id as input will help any user to generate its own qrcode
payment_url format = # upi://pay?pa=UPI_ID&pn=NAME&am=Amount&cu=CURRENCY&tn=MESSAGE
these are all the parameters that helps in payment process
pa = parameter, where we have to initiate the payment
pn = parameter, recipent name
am = parameter, amount
cu = parameter, currency
tn = parameter, message box(after payment)
mc = parameter, merchant code (optioanl)

then,
we have defined the payment url based on UPI ID 
(for eg.) phonepe_url = f'upi://pay?pa={upi_id}&pn=Recipient%20Name&mc=1234'
we can modify these based on the payment apps 

then,
we have created qrcode for payment app
phonepe_qr = qrcode.make(phonepe_url)
(.make is an function imported from qrcode library)

at last,
to display the qrcode 
(for eg.) phonepe_qr.show()
this initiates with the help of pillow library
